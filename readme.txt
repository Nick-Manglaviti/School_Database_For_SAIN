What To Expect not to work:
Most of it is functional, the only thing that are still glitchy that I've attempted to fix were that the "In Progress" Courses
won't show in Current courses Taking ListView. GPA is set and not calculate, admin can only add courses and change majors, but not
delete or change existing ones. I did not save to a binary file. Other than that it works much like the Sain Report, obviously not
 as good because of time constraints but yeah.. Also no Javadocs or JUnit Testing.
